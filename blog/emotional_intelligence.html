                <h3>Core Concepts</h3>
                <h4>Emotional Intelligence</h4>
                <p class="dateheader"><em>September 13, 2021</em></p>
                <p><strong>What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong></p>
                <p>Emotional Intelligence is being able to effectively manage and control the effect your emotions have on your feelings 
                    and how they’re expressed in everyday life. Through improving our own Emotional Intelligence we can more accurately perceive 
                    and identify our own emotions and even better recognise those emotions in others. This in turn helps us interact with others in work, 
                    life, and love across the board. Through listening better and interpreting the words more clearly it helps you to have far more 
                    empathetically charged conversations.</p>
                    <p><strong>How is it different to IQ?</strong></p>
                    <p>IQ is our more rational, analytical, and logic-based area of the brain and it is expressed through how well we 
                        problem-solve and reason with an issue. IQ by its nature differs from EQ in that it can be measured in tests, 
                        stats, figures, and scores. They also differ in the ways a person collects information: someone with a lot of EQ will 
                        focus on the intent behind what is being said or written down and the ways in which that information might improve their 
                        wellbeing or help others; whereas someone who’s more IQ driven will collect and retain that information far more effectively 
                        and will be better suited for recalling or using that knowledge later. This can have drawbacks of course because sometimes forming an 
                        opinion on that information or how it might benefit others isn’t even considered.</p>
                        <p>In computing circles, A.I (Artificial Intelligence) exists already everywhere because information collection and retrieval 
                        is easy for a machine to replicate; but A.E.I (Artificial Emotional Intelligence) on the other hand is considered a new frontier 
                        in research, and a long, long way off from even being properly understood let alone implemented. The neural pathways required for 
                        emotional thought concepts are just so much more complex.</p>
                      <p><strong>Why is EQ important?</strong></p>
                      <p>It just has so many benefits, it can decrease your stress levels in life or work, help build better relationships where needed. 
                          Help a team work better, help individuals work more productively alone and converse better with others. Being more emotionally engaged 
                          helps you become a more rounded, and overall better human being. It is an innate human quality and ability and we should all embrace it as 
                          thinking and flourishing human beings. </p>
