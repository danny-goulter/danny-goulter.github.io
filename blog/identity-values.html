                <h3>Core Concepts</h3>
                <h4>Identity and Values</h4>
                <p class="dateheader"><em>September 12, 2021</em></p>
                <p>Using Evidence I gathered from online personality tests (and talking to my wife), this is how I described my core personal values:</p>
                <p><strong>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values
                     involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</strong></p>
                     <p>At one point while I was living abroad in London I was between jobs and quite desperate for money. I found and 
                         answered a job advertised on a local classifieds website, Gumtree. What I was going to be doing and the money 
                         I was going to get seemed to be too good to be true...and it really turned out to be. 
                        On the surface the job seemed really dodgy so my intuition kicked in and threw up red flags and warning signs all over my brain. 
                        Family I spoke to about it also said I shouldn’t do it. I weighed up their and my concerns against my need to make rent and 
                        support us for a while and I decided to take it. It turned out to be a scam. The bank didn’t blame me or punish me for getting duped by the scam, 
                        so they didn’t make me repay the money, but they did close all my bank accounts immediately and told me I could no longer personally bank 
                        with any of the companies in their entire organisation.
                      </p>
                      <p><strong>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</strong></p>
                      <p>Zealand culture and national identity has more recently pushed individuals to punch above their weight and out-perform 
                          the expectations of our smaller stature. Personally I’ve interpreted this as really wanting to make an impact wherever 
                          I am and make myself and my opinions known. I like to discuss, break down and debate ideas and issues - you could call that 
                          argumentative and combative; but you could also call it engaged and passionate. Traditionally, New Zealand culture has been 
                          about not standing out and being humble about your achievements - we’ve all heard of “Tall Poppy Syndrome.” I completely rally 
                          against this. Achievements should be celebrated both inwardly and outwardly. I believe strongly in having a healthy self-esteem 
                          and a high degree of self-worth and I believe being overly humble is extremely detrimental.</p>
                          <p>Again using that evidence, this is how I described by strengths and limitations:</p>
                          <p><strong>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development:</strong></p>
                          <p>I believe that I have a highly adaptable style of learning. I have an insatiable desire to learn but I can be overly inquisitive 
                              in my learning which can slow down the flow of information when it is being taught to me. Also I have a tendency to skim read when 
                              I’m looking over written material which can cause me to miss key points and details. At times throughout my career I have found myself 
                              in jobs where the learning has stopped and I have hit a knowledge and competencies wall. I don’t imagine this will be the case in working 
                              in Tech and I look forward to seeing my learning evolve as I work.</p>
                            <p><strong>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</strong></p>
                            <p>I had a learning obstacle with one part of my course material and I used my good interpersonal skills to reach out to fellow 
                                students and engage with them for help.</p>
                        <p><strong>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
                            Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and  
                            why:</strong></p>
                            <p>I had a workmate in my previous job that I clashed with constantly and in the end could not effectively work with. I tried many strategies to 
                                repair our working relationship.There was a lot of resistance and tension emanating from her side and it seemed without rational reason. 
                                I approached working with her calmly, directly, broadly, specifically, formally, and informally - nothing seemed to break down the walls in 
                                place. If I were to go back and do it again I would involve more people within the business and undergo some degree of mediation as I had 
                                heard that many other staff members had issues with her working style also.</p>
