                <h4>Exploring Neuroplasticity through having a Growth Mindset</h4>
                <p class="dateheader"><em>September 21, 2021</em></p>
                <h4>Neuroplasticity</h4>
               <p><strong>How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?   
               </strong></p>
            <p>In essence it doesn’t impose society-driven limits on your brain’s power and capacity to continue to learn new skills. It also doesn’t classify people or place them into roles like traditional learning methods do - you show an aptitude for this so you should be that etc, it rather teaches you that a brain can continue to develop and needs mental stimulation not routine.</p>
            <p><strong>How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</strong></p>
            <p>By breaking down the mental barriers I have set myself as a result of my past “failures”. Realising that my previous failures were probably more a product of unsuitable teaching methods as opposed to my level of intellect. Since school I’ve accepted that I’m bad at Exams and learning about neuroplasticity and its associated learning methods is making me realise that this isn’t my problem and I can see that being a huge benefit.</p>

            <p>Training your brain through convincing yourself that this is how our brains are supposed to work and function. Practice skills and imagine the neural pathways firing individually and simultaneously as thought and actions take place.</p>
            <h4>A Growth Mindset</h4>
            <p><strong>What is a Growth Mindset and why is it Relevant?</strong></p>
            <p>Having a growth mindset is not mentally being locked into the idea that you only know a certain amount on a given subject or skill and wrestling with the notion that something can be beyond your level of abilities. A growth mindset is accepting that those abilities continually change and evolve. It’s relevant because put simply, it unlocks your brain’s capacity to learn. </p>
            <p><strong>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</strong></p>
            <p>I realised just how often in the past that I have had a fixed mindset - not just in learning but really across my whole life (which of course through a certain lens can be viewed as a set of learnings) and I can already see the power in changing that mindset.</p>
            <p><strong>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</strong></p>
            <p>By accepting and embracing that I can learn on this journey because that’s what brains are designed to DO.</p>
            <p><strong>How will these understandings shape or influence my learning plan and strategy?</strong></p>
            <p>The important impact on my learning plan with this knowledge in mind is that really my Learning Plan can have no set limitations or implied barriers; my capacity to learn has no limit as long as my brain continues to function. Carol Dweck's breakdown of the word "Yet" and all the power it possesses and how that relates to a journey of learning is truly inspirational. In my old job I was always eager to progress, and I used to say, sort of as a catch-phrase, "You stop learning, you stop living" - well until I started exploring these concepts I never quite knew just how capable my brain was.</p>

            <h4>Helpful Resources</h4>
            <p>As a parent of young children I have become a great admirer of the work <a href="https://www.nathanwallis.com/">Nathan Wallis</a> does in this field. He focuses primarily on the development of the brains of young children and teenagers but I believe many of the concepts he discusses can definitely relate to continuing to exercise our brains in adulthood.</p>
            <p>There's also a brilliant write-up on specifically Neuroplasticity on <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886">this page</a>.
