                    <h4> *UPDATE* October 6th, 2021 - My Learning Plan: The Bootcamp Edition.</h4>
                        <p><strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong>
                            I would like to combine steady available work in the tech industry with my creative passions in sound and audio production. Ideally I would like to be either working in sound development for video games or software applications but I think I would also really enjoy working on content creation, specifically hosting a regular podcast.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</strong>
                            I really thrive on collaboration and group discussion when working on a project, I find my ideas work best when they are bounced off others. On the flipside my time-management can be poor at times and I’m not a very detail orientated person. I tend to rush a task and can miss key steps.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</strong>
                            I feel the time-commitment may be my biggest hurdle. I have two kids and my wife works full-time so I do need to be there for my kids in evenings and weekends (while my wife does preparation work for the week ahead) so I won’t always be able to put in that extra work on a project where needed. I also don’t sleep that well; I like to maximise my time with my wife or hobbies in the evenings once the kids have finally gone to sleep, and this can make the time I should be getting to bed shift further and further back. It’s a constant battle I have with myself in life: I know I have to go to bed to feel healthy and rested; but I want to also feel like I am enjoying being myself and keeping the bond in my marriage strong with togetherness. Finding that balance is very challenging.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong>
                            I have mentioned this before but I would really like to be able to manage my stress responses more effectively. I have to stop it getting the better of me and letting it cloud my focus and hinder my abilities.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</strong>
                            I would really appreciate trust, respect, honesty and support that’s either there or never that far away. I would like to know when I’ve gone wrong on something but never be put down or made an example of with others when I make a mistake.
                        </p> 
                        <p><strong>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</strong>
                            I want to be challenged and I want to be engaged and excited about what I’m working on. I don’t want the workload to feel like a chore or an obligation. I want to come out of it tired mentally but elated with what I have accomplished. I just hope the whole experience makes me grow so much.
                        </p>   
                    </div>
                <p><strong>What is my long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong></p>
                <p>I am a very creative person and I am learning to code and work in the tech industry because I feel that this knowledge 
                    can fund my life and hobbies. I like to podcast and create video content and I feel that knowing code and back-end systems 
                    would be instrumental in being able to create my own online presence and self-manage my career. So if I could be working as a web developer 
                    then this could financially support myself and my family while I am doing what I love.</p>
                    <p><strong>My strengths and limitations in relation to learning:</strong></p>
                    <p>I did cover this somewhat in my Identity and Values exploration but I’ll expand on it here further. I have a tendency to skim read and gloss 
                        over important details because I can be impatient. So to that end I sometimes expect measurable progress far too soon without putting in the necessary 
                        work and research. I am a very adaptable learner and I am highly inquisitive in my learning. I like to discuss and debate subjects while I learn them 
                        which I think helps the whole group learn more.</p>
                    <p><strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would I like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy?</strong></p>
                    <p>I would like to become a more relaxed person overall by learning more strategies to deal with stress and not let it get the better of me. 
                        I would like to explore concepts of mindfulness more and have that govern my life to a larger degree.</p>
                        <p>Described below is a commitment to how I will manage my workload within this program:</p>
                    <p><strong>How I will manage myself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives:</strong></p>
                    <p>I will plan my time well into manageable blocks and plan breaks to recharge, refocus and keep my mind engaged. 
                        I will however keep communication channels with my facilitator and those in my cohort open at all times and respond in a timely manner when I am contacted.</p>
                    <p><strong>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</strong></p>
                    <p>Take a minute, and step away from the issue/problem that has triggered the build-up and clear my head. Maybe even move away from my computer entirely. 
                        I will then tackle the problem by engaging with it from a fresher angle.</p>
                    <p><strong>How and where will I seek help in a timely way</strong></p>
                    <p>I will rely on others in my cohort for advice and use online resources I have discovered so far in my learning and of course use Google.</p>
                    <p><strong>What I expect from the facilitation team:</strong></p>
                    <p>To support and guide my learning and keep me on the right path at all times.</p>
                    <p><strong>Is there scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things while doing my course?</strong></p>
                    <p>During Foundations I will be dropping my children off at their respective schools at 8:30am and picking them up at 3pm. Around those times I’m needed
                         for childcare so I can work on my course-work for roughly six hours a day. I will also try to fit in some work in the evenings while my wife is doing prep-work 
                         and marking for her teaching job. During Bootcamp my wife and I intend to increase the amount of time our children spend in Preschool and before and after 
                         school care so I can increase the amount of time I can work on my course throughout the day.</p>
