                <h4>What is Reflection in this context?</h4>
                <p>
                  I have covered this already in some of my other blog posts here but reflection is an incredibly underrated concept in learning. Looking over something you've just learned and re-evaluating its concepts helps solidify them in your brain. The process fires different neural pathways and regions of your brain which pushes the knowledge deeper down and it never means you are being repetitive or learning things again. It's important to remember that Reflection is <em>never</em> a waste of time. If you're learning a new skill and you think of Research, Practice and Reflection as a Sandwich; then not doing proper Reflection at the end of an exercise is like trying to make an successful sandwich with only one piece of bread.

                  So I've taken some time in the last couple of days to reflect on my time thus far in Dev Academy, particularly of course on my journey through the sometimes turbulent but ultimately very rewarding Foundations curriculum. Here is some of what I've learned so far, zeroing in on core concepts and further focusing in on what they have taught me about myself:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</strong> Number one I have learned to shelve my pre-conceived notions about what my abilities are and what they made me apparently suited to doing with my life, this process has unlocked in me my capacity to learn and grow my brain through challenging it. Number two, these imaginary short-comings I had manufactured for myself had affected my ego in the past too but really this program has made me think of and evaluate my ego far less than I used to. This leads into Number three: defining and analysing your ego to too large a degree for me feeds into the idea of labelling or constricting yourself too much and letting it limit your potential which this this school has taught me not to do.</li>
                  
                  <li><strong>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</strong> Programming is very often about problem-solving and collaborating with others through a project and working through its associated bugs. You cannot effectively do any of this without a good set of core values and empathy. Self-Awareness helps immensely with knowing where you can best fit in and help in a collaborative programming setting and utilise your unique skill set.</li>
                  
                  <li><strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong>
                   Learning the concept of neuroplasticity and adopting a growth mindset. I’ve been stuck in learning ruts a lot of times in my life and I’ve put them down to preconceived notions about what I can learn, what I’m good at, or what my limitations might be. I realise now, and I thank the core learning for this, that a lot that is just plain rubbish. I have the capacity to learn any skill with practice and dedication. Really anyone does, and that knowledge is truly powerful.</li>
                   
                   <li><strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong> In general I've always found it difficult to talk at length about myself and analyse myself and then express those findings to others, in short opening up with my emotions. So thinking about my <a href="../blog/identity-values.html">identity and values</a> and presenting that inner-thought soup for all to consume was particularly challenging.</li>

                   <li><strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</strong> Learning and developing these skills is so vitally important in working your head around any discipline and truthfully should be implemented in every educational institution across the board that teaches anything. I mean it, this Programming School teaches you so much more than just programming; it teaches you to stretch and open up the power of your brain and become a more well-rounded human being who thankfully as a handy bonus, also knows how to code. The Dev Academy should really be lauded everywhere for this.</li>

                   <li><strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong> I don't agree with these questions at all. Not even in the tiniest little infinitesimal way. As I have already alluded to, these core learnings are immeasurably important and have done so much for me personally. I feel doing this course without them would definitely be time poorly spent. I never expected them going into this course, especially when this course is comparatively short when pitted against other IT related courses on offer out there in the teritary-ed sphere.</li>
                </ul>
                  <p>
                     I feel so much richer for having them exposed to me. I truly thank EDA for that and I know this is a cliche, but I <em>actually</em> will be forever grateful.
                  </p>
