                <h4>CSS - Concepts: Margin, Padding, and Borders</h4>
                <p><em>September 11, 2021</em></p>
                  <p>To begin, CSS language is what makes a website look the way it does because it adds
                      style attributes to HTML, which is the language of the web which form the building-blocks of a website.
                  </p>
                  <p>In CSS we often talk about Margins, Borders, Padding, and Content. But what are all
                      these concepts and what do they mean? They can be explained visually in what's known as the Box Model</p>
                      <img class="blogpics" src="../blog/images/css-margin.webp" alt="the Box Model">
                      <p>A Webpage, which is under-the-hood a page of HTML code, is a collection of Elements and each of
                          those elements are represented by these four concepts of the Box Model. First let me explain what these concepts are,
                          using something we all know:
                      </p>
                      <img class="blogpics" src="../blog/images/cake.jpeg" alt="Some Chocolate Cake">
                      <p><strong>Chocolate Cake!</strong></p>
                      <p>So with this now as our very familiar (and very yummy) frame of reference we can move from the inside out and it breaks down like this:</p>
                      <ol>
                          <li>The Content: this is the main part of the element, in this case it's the Chocolate, the core and the essence that indeed gives the cake it's name.
                              In an HTML element it might be the image we focus on or a block of text that we read. It is the most recognisable of the four concepts.
                          </li>
                          <br>
                          <li>The Padding: this in the cake is like a layer of sponge or cream filler. Padding can be used to create white space between the content and it's border to embellish the content.
                            </li>
                          <br>
                          <li>The Border: This is it, the Icing on the cake. A border can really define an element and make it stand out.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li>The Margin: finally we come to the decorative stand or plate that the cake sits on. If this cake was in a cafe cabinet along with other sweet treats
                              you would really want to give it some space to let it show itself off. </li>
                      </ol>
                      
                    <p>Mmm, delicious...wait, I'm getting off track, the point is, it's good to know how these concepts can be defined when you begin to manipulate them on an HTML element using CSS. Using the CSS concepts
                        <strong>border, padding,</strong> and <strong>margin,</strong> you can change the size of each of these attributes of an element 
                        which talks to the element's HTML and thus changes how it appears on a webpage. <strong>Margin</strong> for example can change the white space <em>outside</em> your element in relation to other elements and <strong>Padding</strong>
                         changes that space <em>inside</em> an element perhaps to frame an image with white space inside a dark border. So <strong>border</strong> always separates the <strong>padding</strong> and <strong>margin</strong> even it's not set to be visible. CSS <strong>border</strong>
                         can be used to accentuate the look of an element when a width and weight is applied.
                        </p>
                        <p>Every single thing on a webpage has these four attributes and CSS is a powerful and robust tool for organising these elements into a visually digestible webpage. Have fun experimenting
                            and always remember: if you get stuck, Google is your friend. </p>
